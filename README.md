**About Project:** In this project, I undertook the redesign of an existing ecommerce website, utilizing the design tools and features of Figma. I acquired numerous skills while redesigning this website. for designing  a website wireframing is very important step, Wireframing is classified as three types  low-fidelity, mid-fidelity and high-fidelity. In this project, I opted for mid-fidelity wireframes to outline the interface design effectively.
